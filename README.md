isONclust
========

isONclust is a tool for clustering either PacBio Iso-Seq reads, or Oxford Nanopore reads into clusters, where each cluster represents all reads that came from a gene. Output is a tsv file with each read assigned to a cluster-ID. Detailed information is available in [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/06/463463).  


isONclust is distributed as a python package supported on Linux / OSX with python v>=2.7, and 3.4-3.6, 3.5-dev and 3.6-dev [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ksahlin/isONclust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ksahlin/isONclust)

INSTALLATION
----------------

### Using conda
Conda is the preferred way to install isONclust.

1. Create and activate a new environment called isonclust

```
conda create -n isonclust python=3 pip 
source activate isonclust
```

2. Install isONclust 

```
pip install isONclust
```
3. You should now have 'isONclust' installed; try it:
```
isONclust --help
```

Upon start/login to your server/computer you need to activate the conda environment "isonclust" to run isONclust as:
```
source activate isonclust
```

### Using pip 

To install isONclust, run:
```
pip install  isONclust
```
`pip` will install the dependencies automatically for you. `pip` is pythons official package installer and is included in most python versions. If you do not have `pip`, it can be easily installed [from here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and upgraded with `pip install --upgrade pip`. 


### Downloading source from GitHub

#### Dependencies

Make sure the below listed dependencies are installed (installation links below). Versions in parenthesis are suggested as IsoCon has not been tested with earlier versions of these libraries. However, IsoCon may also work with earliear versions of these libaries.
* [parasail](https://github.com/jeffdaily/parasail-python)
* [pysam](http://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) (>= v0.11)


With these dependencies installed. Run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ksahlin/isONclust.git
cd isONclust
./isONclust
```

### Testing installation

You can verify successul installation by running isONclust on this [small dataset](https://github.com/ksahlin/isONclust/tree/master/test/sample_alz_2k.fastq). Simply download the test dataset and run:

```
isONclust --fastq [test/sample_alz_2k.fastq] --outfolder [output path]
```


USAGE
-------

IsONclust can be used with either Iso-Seq or ONT reads. It takes either a fastq file or ccs.bam file. 
 


### Iso-Seq

IsONclust works with full-lengh non-chimeric (flnc) reads that has quality values assigned to bases. If you already have such a fastq file generated for your reads, isONclust can be run as 

```
isONclust pipeline --isoseq --fastq <reads.fastq> --outfolder </path/to/output> 
```

If not, flnc reads can be generated as follows. Raw pacbio subreads needs to be proccesed with `ccs` with the command `--polish` (to get quality values), followed by `lima`, and `isoseq3 cluster` to get the flnc reads. The flnc file is generated at the very beginning of the `isoseq3 cluster` algorithm and it can be used once its created (no need to wait for isoseq3 to finish). See full documentation on generating flnc reads at [isoseq3](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/IsoSeq3). After these three comands are run isONclust can be run as follows
```
isONclust --isoseq --ccs <ccs.bam> --flnc <flnc.bam> --outfolder </path/to/output> 
```
Where `<ccs.bam>` is the file generated from `ccs` and `<flnc.bam>` is the file generated from `isoseq3 cluster`. The argument `--isoseq` simply means `--k 15 --w 50`. These arguments can be set manually without the `--isoseq` flag. Specify number of cores with `--t`. 


### Oxford Nanopore
isONclust needs a fastq file generated by an Oxford Nanopore basecaller.

```
IsoCon pipeline --ont --fastq <reads.fastq> --outfolder </path/to/output> 
```
The argument `--ont` simply means `--k 13 --w 20`. These arguments can be set manually without the `--ont` flag. Specify number of cores with `--t`. 

#### Output

The output consists of a tsv file with the first column being the cluster ID, and the second column being the read accession, as follows
```
0 read_X_acc
0 read_Y_acc
...
n read_Z_acc
```
if there are n reads there will be n rows. Some reads might be singletons. The rows are ordered with respect to the size of the cluster (largest first).

                        Minmum mapped fraction of read to be included in

  --aligned_threshold ALIGNED_THRESHOLD
                        Minmum aligned fraction of read to be included in
                        cluster. Aligned identity depends on the quality of

                        Minmum fraction of minimizers shared compared to best

                        considered as mapped region, under assumption that
                        they come from the same transcript (depends on read
                        quality). (default: 0.1)
  --outfolder OUTFOLDER
                        A fasta file with transcripts that are shared between
                        samples and have perfect illumina support. (default:
