//! `cluster.parasail_block_alignment` and `cluster.get_best_cluster_block_align`.
//!
//! The alignment fallback: when the mapping decision fails but the read still
//! shares at least `--min_shared` minimizers, isONclust aligns it against the
//! tied-at-the-top candidates and clusters on the fraction of the alignment that
//! sits in a sufficiently-matching window.
//!
//! This path is not a rare corner. On `droso_20k` it decides **10 309 of 19 938
//! reads** and accounts for 47% of the reference's clustering time.
//!
//! Details that decide bytes:
//!
//! * **The gap-opening penalty is chosen per comparison** from the two reads'
//!   summed error rates, binned at 0.01 / 0.04 / 0.1 into 5 / 4 / 3 / 2. Every
//!   one of the four occurs in practice.
//! * **`match_id` is `floor((1 - error_rate_sum) * k)`**, and `math.floor`
//!   returns an int, so the comparison below is integer-against-integer.
//! * **The rolling window is over ALIGNMENT columns, not read positions**, and
//!   its length is `k`. The count of "aligned" columns is then divided by
//!   `len(s1)` -- the *unaligned* query length -- so the ratio can exceed 1.
//! * **Only candidates tied at the top hit count are considered** (`if nm_hits <
//!   top_hits: break`), which is stricter than `get_best_cluster`'s
//!   `min_fraction` walk.
