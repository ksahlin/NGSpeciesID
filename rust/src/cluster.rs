//! `cluster.get_all_hits` and `cluster.get_best_cluster` -- the mapping decision.
//!
//! This is where a read is compared against the representatives it shares
//! minimizers with, and either joins one or becomes a representative itself.
//!
//! Three things decide bytes:
//!
//! * **The candidate ranking is a total order.** `sorted(..., key=(len,
//!   sum(positions), acc), reverse=True)`. `minimizer_database` values are
//!   Python **sets of ints**, so the insertion order of the hit dicts is
//!   set-iteration order -- but the third sort key is the representative's
//!   accession, and accessions are unique, so no tie ever falls through to it.
//!   Measured, not assumed: 120/120, 9972/9972 and 19938/19938 distinct
//!   accessions on the three corpora. `assert_unique_accessions` re-checks it at
//!   runtime, because it is a property of the data rather than of the algorithm.
//! * **`reduce(mul, [p] * n, 1)` is a left fold, not `p.powi(n)`.** It multiplies
//!   `p` into an accumulator `n` times starting from the integer 1. The two
//!   differ in the low bits, and this value gates whether a span counts as
//!   mapped.
//! * **The first candidate over the threshold wins**, and the walk stops early
//!   at `nm_hits < min_fraction * top_hits`.
