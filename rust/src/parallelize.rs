//! `modules/parallelize.py` -- the `--t > 1` path.
//!
//! **This is a different algorithm, not a parallelised version of the same one.**
//! Reads are cut into batches, each batch is clustered independently, the
//! surviving representatives are pooled and re-batched, and the whole thing
//! repeats until one batch remains. `--t` therefore changes the answer: on the
//! smoke corpus `--t 1` gives 40 clusters and `--t 8` gives 35. See PORTING.md,
//! Finding 3.
//!
//! **The batches are independent, so execution order is free.** Each worker
//! receives its own cluster map, representative map, read slice and minimizer
//! database, and returns new ones; nothing is shared. `pool.map_async` preserves
//! result order, so running the batches sequentially gives byte-identical output
//! to running them in parallel. That is why this is written sequentially first:
//! the batching structure is what has to be exact, and threading it afterwards
//! is behaviour-neutral.
