//! Python's `round(x, 2)`.
//!
//! `p_shared_minimizer_empirical` rounds both error rates to two decimals and
//! uses the result as a dict key, so this decides which of the 15 probability
//! buckets a read lands in -- and therefore which reads cluster together.
//!
//! Python's `round(x, n)` is **correctly rounded on the exact binary value**,
//! with ties (which need an exactly representable midpoint) going to even. It is
//! not "multiply by 100, round, divide": that double-rounds and disagrees.
//! Measured on the reference:
//!
//! | x | `round(x, 2)` | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0.005 | **0.01** | the double is 0.005000000000000000104…, just above the midpoint |
//! | 0.015 | **0.01** | the double is 0.01499999999999999944…, just below |
//! | 0.025 | **0.03** | just above |
//! | 0.045 | **0.04** | just below |
//! | 0.125 | **0.12** | exactly representable, so the tie breaks to even |
//!
//! Rust's `{:.2}` formatting is also exact and also breaks ties to even, so
//! formatting and parsing back reproduces it. `rust/tests/pyround_oracle.rs`
//! checks that against CPython over a large sample rather than trusting it.
