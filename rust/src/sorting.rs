//! `modules/get_sorted_fastq_for_cluster.py`, ported: score every read, drop the
//! ones that fail the filters, sort by score descending, write `sorted.fastq`
//! and `logfile.txt`.
//!
//! Four things here decide bytes and are easy to get subtly wrong:
//!
//! * **Two phred tables.** `D` caps the per-base error probability at
//!   `0.79433`; `D_no_min` does not. The rolling no-error product uses the
//!   capped one, `error_rate` uses the uncapped one. The cap bites only on `!`
//!   (phred 0) and it is live: 121 of the retired corpus's reads contain one.
//! * **`sum()` is compensated.** The reference is pinned to Python >=3.12,
//!   where `sum()` over floats is Neumaier-compensated and therefore exactly
//!   rounded. `poisson_mean` sums over `set(qual)` -- a set, whose order is
//!   `PYTHONHASHSEED`-dependent -- so the compensation is what makes the
//!   reference deterministic at all (PORTING.md, Finding 1). Reproducing it
//!   exactly is what frees this code to iterate in any order it likes.
//! * **`math.log(x, 10)` is not `log10(x)`.** The reference computes
//!   `log(x)/log(10)`, which differs from `log10` in the last bit for 58% of
//!   values. No filter flip was observed in 800 000 trials, but exactness is
//!   the specification.
//! * **`sum_of_expectations` is a plain running `+=`,** not `sum()`, so it is
//!   *not* compensated. Sequential addition, in order.
