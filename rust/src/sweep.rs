//! `cluster.reads_to_clusters` -- the greedy sweep.
//!
//! Reads are visited highest-score first. Each is compared against the
//! representatives it shares minimizers with; if it joins one it contributes
//! nothing further, and if it does not it becomes a representative and **all of
//! its minimizers enter the database**. The database only grows, so a read is
//! only ever compared against representatives that already exist -- which is why
//! the score order has to be exact.
//!
//! The signature carries the multiprocessing machinery even in single-core
//! mode, because the reference's does: `parallel_clustering` calls this same
//! function with a pre-populated cluster map, a carried-over minimizer database,
//! and a batch index, and the sweep's first act is to **skip every read whose
//! previous batch index equals the lowest in the batch** -- those are the reads
//! that built the database being reused.
//!
//! Order of business per read, matching the reference's numbered comments:
//!
//! 1. homopolymer-compress and take minimizers (short reads are skipped)
//! 2. compute the compressed-read error rate, unless it is already there --
//!    the reference branches on `len(representatives[id]) == 7`
//! 3. collect hits against the database
//! 4. try to map
//! 5. if mapping failed but at least `--min_shared` minimizers were shared, align
//! 6. record the assignment, or become a representative and add the minimizers
//! 7. reassign: move every recorded read into its target's cluster
