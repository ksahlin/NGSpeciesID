# Step 0 of repo slimming: get the data out of git before it is stripped.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This extracts blobs from HISTORY, not from disk. NGSpeciesID's large test data
# was deleted from HEAD long ago, so there is nothing in the working tree to
# archive: the only remaining copy of those 520 MB is inside .git, reachable
# through old commits. Once history is rewritten they are gone for good.
#
# It walks every path ever committed under test/, SKIPS the ones still present
# in HEAD (those survive the rewrite and are on analyze.sh's KEEP list -- five
# live fixtures the README links), pulls the newest blob for each of the rest,
# and writes it out with a checksummed manifest.
#
# BEFORE RUNNING THIS: check whether the same blobs are already archived from
# the isONclust exercise. NGSpeciesID was forked from isONclust and inherited
# its test data, so test/ccs.fastq.gz.part-{aa,ab,ac,ad},
# test/ENS_100k.fastq.tar.gz, test/old_sorted_ens_100k.fastq.tar.gz and
# test/sample_alz_2k.fastq are very likely byte-identical to blobs already sat
# in isONclust/repo-slim-archive/. Compare sha256 before spending 500 MB twice.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# By DEFAULT this only builds archives locally and prints what it would upload.
# Uploading publishes ~500 MB under your account and is not something this
# script does on its own -- pass --upload once you have looked at what was built.

Archives built locally. NOTHING HAS BEEN UPLOADED.

  raw files : $RAW  ($(du -sh "$RAW" | cut -f1))
  archive   : $DATA_TGZ  ($(du -h "$DATA_TGZ" | cut -f1))

Review them, then pick a home.

RECOMMENDED: Zenodo, if any of this data is worth citing.

  1. https://zenodo.org  ->  New upload
  2. Drag in $(basename "$DATA_TGZ") and MANIFEST.txt
  3. Upload type "Dataset"; title e.g.
       "NGSpeciesID: test data removed from git history"
  4. Link it to the publication DOI (10.1089/cmb.2019.0299) under
     "Related/alternate identifiers"
  5. Publish, then note the record id from the URL

ALTERNATIVE: a GitHub Release, beside the code, no DOI. Re-run with --upload, or:

  gh release create "$TAG" \\
    --title "Test data removed from git history" \\
    --notes "Data stripped from history to make the repository cloneable. See MANIFEST.txt." \\
$(printf '    %s \\\n' "${ASSETS[@]}" | sed '$ s/ \\$//')

A THIRD OPTION, and the one that was taken: do not publish it at all. None of
these files is referenced by any test, script or README, and the repository's
fixture was replaced by a 356 KB corpus with better discriminating power
(PORTING.md, Finding 5). A local copy is enough.

Note what publishing would NOT achieve: the data is still present in all 9
forks, whose default branches carry it live, and GitHub shares object storage
across a fork network. Stripping it from the canonical repository does not make
it unreachable. See PORTING.md, "Repo hygiene".

Either way: confirm what you keep is readable BEFORE running slim.sh. After the
rewrite, $RAW is the only remaining copy.
