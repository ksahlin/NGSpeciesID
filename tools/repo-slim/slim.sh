================================================================================
Rewritten mirror is ready. NOTHING HAS BEEN PUSHED.

  $MIRROR

Before you push, understand what this does:

  * Every commit SHA changes. All 16 forks diverge permanently and cannot be
    fast-forwarded. Anyone with a clone (68 stargazers, 16 forks) must re-clone.
  * All four tags -- 0.0.4, v0.1.2.1, v0.3.0, v0.3.1 -- move to rewritten
    commits. Verified above that all four survive and that their trees are clean.
  * Commit-pinned links break, including any in the paper (10.1002/ece3.7146)
    and in the field-protocol manuscript the README's EXAMPLE WORKFLOW describes.
  * The README links test/Supplementary_File1_reads.fastq,
    test/Supplementary_File2_minibar.txt, test/Supplementary_File3_primer.txt
    and test/consensus.sh by path on the default branch. Those paths are on the
    KEEP list and are asserted unchanged above, so the links keep working --
    but re-check them after the push rather than trusting this sentence.
  * GitHub keeps the old objects reachable for a while; stripped data may remain
    downloadable via old SHAs until GitHub garbage-collects. Ask GitHub Support
    to run gc if that matters. This is public test data, so it is a tidiness
    issue rather than a disclosure one.

Recommended order (skip anything already done):

  1. Archive the data. ALREADY DONE if repo-slim-archive/ exists:
       tools/repo-slim/archive_data.sh
     This pulls the blobs out of HISTORY, not the working tree -- the large
     test/ files were deleted from HEAD long ago, so .git is the only remaining
     copy. Verify the archive reads back before continuing:
       gzip -t  repo-slim-archive/raw/test/ccs.fastq.gz
       tar -tzf repo-slim-archive/raw/test/ENS_100k.fastq.tar.gz
       head -2  repo-slim-archive/raw/test/sample_alz_2k.fastq
     CHECK FIRST whether these exact blobs are already archived from the
     isONclust exercise, which stripped the same four ccs.fastq.gz parts and the
     same two ENS_100k tarballs from the same upstream history:
       ls ~/isONclust-preslim-backup.git 2>/dev/null
       ls /Users/*/source/isONclust/repo-slim-archive/raw/test/ 2>/dev/null
     If they are, there is no reason to spend 500 MB on a second copy.

  2. Back up the pre-rewrite history LOCALLY. Do not rely on a tag pushed to
     origin for this: filter-repo rewrites tags too, so the mirror push moves
     any such tag onto the rewritten commit. Worse, a tag left pointing at the
     old history would keep every stripped byte alive on the server AND get
     fetched by \`git clone\` (which pulls tags by default), undoing the whole
     exercise. Keep the old history off origin:
       git clone --mirror "$REPO_ROOT" ~/NGSpeciesID-preslim-backup.git

  3. Push the rewritten history. filter-repo removes the 'origin' remote from
     the mirror, so push to the URL rather than to a remote name:
       git -C "$MIRROR" push --force --mirror $ORIGIN

  4. Re-clone fresh and confirm, including that the README's four linked
     test/ files are still there:
       git clone $ORIGIN /tmp/NGSpeciesID-verify
       du -sh /tmp/NGSpeciesID-verify
       ls -la /tmp/NGSpeciesID-verify/test/

  5. No fixture needs putting back -- unlike isONclust, every fixture the README
     and .travis.yml reference is on the KEEP list and survives the rewrite.
     What DOES need to go back on top is a .gitignore for the junk this rewrite
     just removed, so it cannot come back:
       printf '__pycache__/\\n*.py[cod]\\n.DS_Store\\n' >> /tmp/NGSpeciesID-verify/.gitignore
     ...plus PORTING.md, bench/ and tools/repo-slim/ itself, which is where the
     port starts.

Step 3 is the irreversible one.
